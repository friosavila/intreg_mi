    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following analysis, all the data process is done in the file [`example.do`](example.do).\n",
    "\n",
    "This do-file loads the data and creates auxiliary variables that mimic the interval censoring of the data (in this case household income). We use the brackets of income that are generally used for collecting Family income data in the monthly CPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because household income is not likely to follow a conditional normal distribution, we use the log of household income percapita as the variable to be imputed. We recover the original scale of the data after imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the brackets data, it estimates the heteroskedastic interval regression model, and then uses the `intreg_mi` command to obtain the imputations for the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The imputed data is then used to estimate Poverty Status across selected groups, using the fully observed data, and the imputed data.\n",

    "## Model Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "For imputation we assume `official total income` are a function of household demographics including # adults, # working adults, # children, # of ppl with higher education, #region, House ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "For modeling, we only the estimation of poverty headcounts by different groups groups\n",
